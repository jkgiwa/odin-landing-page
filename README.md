# odin-landing-page

In this project, I have created a landing page using the image of a landing page made by The Odin Project as guidance. I have made use of the flexbox feature, to organise the elements on the page. I also made use of margin and padding to properly align and space out the elements.

During the creation of this landing page, the difficulties I encountered were making sure flex-items were visually aligned. I found that using the div element over the h3 element in the blue banner section, allowed for the text to be better centred.
I also struggled with the look of the buttons, however with some help from this youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_c6hkIo4LxA.
